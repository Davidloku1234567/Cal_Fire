## 1. Introduction

Living in California, I am no stranger to fires and the damage they cause. 2019 may cost the state as much as $80 billion in lost property and economic activity. This is not a problem that is getting better. I personally had to drive through a major fire zone just to commute to work in 2017. People lose homes, national parks close and the economy is disrupted for millions of Californians. I believe that data can help anticipate when fires are going to burn the longest.

## 2. Problem Statement


Using historical fire data, I will attempt to predict the burn duration of a fire given a location within the state of California. 
For these purposes "burn duration" is defined as time from fire ignition to 100% fire containment as reported by the local fire officials. For those unfamiliar with fire terminology, "containment" is how fire officials define that a fire will no longer spread past fire defenses such as fire breaks. 

I will also attempt to predict the frequency of fire occurances in the state of California.
